# Repository Contents
This is a collection of utilities that I've re-written for red team engagements. Most of these are not original ideas, only rewrites.

## Name Generator
Pass a text file containing first and last names. The utility will output name permutations for password spraying attacks. Example `python name_generator.py --infile listofnames.txt --outfile namepermutations.txt`.
